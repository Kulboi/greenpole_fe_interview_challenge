## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a simple code challenge for testing your ability to build frontend applications
using reactjs, redux and sass. Your solution should be submitted on or before **7pm 20/11/2020**.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs (that can be found in the **design_files** folder).

User should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

You should specifically use reactjs framework for this.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design_files` folder.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

There are no assets for this challenge, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.

There is a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Stack

- Framework: reactjs
- State management: redux
- Styling language: scss

## Sharing your solution

Push to a public github repository and share links to the repository when done


**Have fun building and best of luck!** ðŸš€
